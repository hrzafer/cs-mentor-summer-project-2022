* Introduction 

This project is designed by cs mentor students. It is an initial task of the project. Small React project with Eslint and Prettier. You can see the additional details by looking at the files. 

* Requirements 

Node.js 
React 
Vs Code 
Eslint and Prettier tools for vs code 

Eslint and Prettier Installation 

https://dev.to/knowankit/setup-eslint-and-prettier-in-react-app-357b



* Installation 

You can get the project repo whether download the project from Github or clone the repository with command line. In the project directory, you can see the main files in src folder. 

1. Command Line 

% git clone git@github.com:hrzafer/cs-mentor-summer-project-2022.git (SSH)

% cd cs-mentor-summer-project-2022 

% code . 

2. You can download the files from Github



* Configuration 

Since the project directory is public, you can see the files in the project. 

If you installed the project files, 

You can open project directory choosing open folder section in vs code or you can use internal command line. Using command line; 

cd cs-mentor-summer-project
cd frontend 
code . 

You can run the project; 

% npm run start (which explains the commands below) 




* Troubleshooting and FAQ

As of now, Eslint is available for the project and can detect the errors and mistakes. 

And, if you can not access the project directory using command line you can use the vs code internal command line. 

you may also have trouble accessing the project directory using command line (code .). In that case, you can use vs code open folder section to access the project files. 


### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
